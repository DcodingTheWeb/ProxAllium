= ProxAllium Configuration

== Introduction

This document will outline all of the available configuration options in ProxAllium. The defaults are pretty good so an average user can do without reading this, but advanced users may want to access one of the more advanced features and change the defaults to suit their needs.

It goes without saying that you should know what you are doing, otherwise you may have unexpected consequences!

== Config File

ProxAllium uses a single `config.ini` file which is stored alongside the binary, it uses the reasonably simple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Format[INI] format to store your preferences.

Don't worry about getting the format to follow the rules outlined in the wiki, AutoIt's INI parser is quite flexible and will be able to process your output as long it is readable by a human. Try taking the automatically generated key/value pairs as an example.

NOTE: Don't forget to regenerate Tor configuration if you change anything which effects Tor!
